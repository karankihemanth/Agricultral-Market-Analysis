# Agricultral-Market-Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on the geographical and market analysis of the agricultural sector. It includes a detailed study of price trends across different states, identifying key market trends, and understanding variations in modal prices.

## Data Sources
The dataset used for this analysis includes:
- Agricultural market price data from various states
- Geographical information to correlate price trends with location-specific factors

## Analysis Performed
### 1. Geographical Analysis
- Examined the distribution of agricultural markets across states
- Identified key agricultural producing states
- Mapped agricultural trade flow based on market data

### 2. Market Analysis
- Evaluated modal price trends across different states
- Identified states with the highest and lowest average modal prices
- Analyzed fluctuations in market prices over time

## Price Trends Across States
### States with the Highest Average Modal Prices:
1. **Goa** - ₹20,750
2. **Andaman and Nicobar** - ₹14,073
3. **Meghalaya** - ₹9,391
